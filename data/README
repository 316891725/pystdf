The STDF files in this directory were originally provided on Galaxy 
Semiconductor's website for demonstration of their tools.  They were 
obtained from this public URL, which I found via Google search:

http://www.galaxysemi.com/examinator/support/install.htm

I am including them here for testing pystdf at the user's convenience.
If you feel they cannot be legally distributed as such, you can send me an 
email to state your case, which I will consider thoughtfully.

I also welcome any user contributions of example STDF data, especially
different ATE platforms and STDF versions.
